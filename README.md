## Welcome to my project!
This is a project that I am doing for school at the moment. I would like to set up a server or two to launch this
as a website, but as of right now being a student I cannot afford building a server or maintaining one so I am 
opensourceing my project to see what happens.

This is just a fun project I am using to try to test my skills at coding and integrating things into a website or html
document


Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Maxz963/Webpage-project-of-meme/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
