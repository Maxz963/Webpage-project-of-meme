It's a project I'm still working on to make a fully functional website, I know it sounds stupid as there is over 40,000,000 terabytes of data uploaded every day to the internet so why not add something to that? I want to learn how to build a network of computers and make a server using docker to get this thing all up and running. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this and have a wonderful day!
