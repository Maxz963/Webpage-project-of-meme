## Welcome to my project!
This is a project that I am doing for school at the moment. I would like to set up a server or two to launch this
as a website, but as of right now being a student I cannot afford building a server or maintaining one so I am 
opensourceing my project to see what happens.

This is just a fun project I am using to try to test my skills at coding and integrating things into a website or html
document
